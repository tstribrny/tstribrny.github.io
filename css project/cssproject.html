          Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest
          conductor Aram Demirjian present a powerhouse program highlighted by
          Vivaldi's programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking and
          admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the
          essence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through music that
          manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its debut.
          Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in
          its return to Boettcher Concert Hall. The grand finale — Tchaikovsky's
          Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate that
          endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over
          four movements, Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate
          into one of humanity's most powerful works of art. Among today's best
          and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery's Strum draws on the spirit
          of dance, movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic
          celebration that will have you on the edge of your seat.
