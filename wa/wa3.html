    <h1> It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</h1>
    <strong> It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</strong> is an American sitcom created by Rob McElhenney and developed 
    with Glenn Howerton for FX. It premiered on August 4, 2005, and was moved to FXX beginning with 
    the ninth season in 2013. It stars Charlie Day, Howerton, McElhenney, Kaitlin Olson, and Danny DeVito. 
    The series follows the exploits of "The Gang", a group of narcissistic and sociopathic friends who run 
    the Irish dive bar Paddy's Pub in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but spend most of their free time 
    drinking, scheming, arguing amongst themselves, and plotting elaborate cons against others, and at 
    times each other, for personal benefit, financial gain, revenge, or simply due to boredom or inebriation.
    
    With its 15th season, the series became the longest running live-action American sitcom, and the longest 
    running series ever on cable TV surpassing The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for 14 seasons 
    (435 episodes) between 1952 and 1966. In December 2020, the series was renewed for a total of four 
    additional seasons, bringing it to 18 seasons.[8] The 16th season premiered on June 7, 2023.[9] The show 
    has received critical acclaim, with many lauding the cast performances and dark humor. It has amassed a 
    large cult following.

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    The series follows a group of misfit, narcissistic sociopaths, referred to as "The Gang", who run a meager,
    unsuccessful Irish bar called Paddy's Pub in the neighborhood of South Philadelphia. The Gang originally 
    consisted of janitor Charlie Kelly (Charlie Day), bouncer Mac (Rob McElhenney), and bartender Dennis Reynolds
    (Glenn Howerton), the three of whom own Paddy's Pub, in addition to Dennis' twin sister Dee Reynolds (Kaitlin
    Olson), a struggling actress who works as a waitress there. In season 2, they are joined by Frank Reynolds 
    (Danny DeVito), an eccentric millionaire and the neglectful father of the Reynolds twins, who takes over most 
    of the ownership of the bar. He soon becomes the financial catalyst for the Gang, often funding many of the 
    Gang's over-complicated plots, while simultaneously succumbing to the brazen depravity of the group.
