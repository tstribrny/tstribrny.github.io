    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>The series follows a group of misfit, narcissistic sociopaths, referred to as "The Gang", who run a meager,</p>
    <p>unsuccessful Irish bar called Paddy's Pub in the neighborhood of South Philadelphia. The Gang originally </p>
    <p>consisted of janitor Charlie Kelly (Charlie Day), bouncer Mac (Rob McElhenney), and bartender Dennis Reynolds</p>
    <p>(Glenn Howerton), the three of whom own Paddy's Pub, in addition to Dennis' twin sister Dee Reynolds (Kaitlin</p>
    <p> Olson), a struggling actress who works as a waitress there. In season 2, they are joined by Frank Reynolds </p>
    <p>(Danny DeVito), an eccentric millionaire and the neglectful father of the Reynolds twins, who takes over most </p>
    <p>of the ownership of the bar. He soon becomes the financial catalyst for the Gang, often funding many of the </p>
    <p>Gang's over-complicated plots, while simultaneously succumbing to the brazen depravity of the group.</p>
